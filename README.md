# AcademyXi-Phase0-Project (https://seenuchaparala.github.io/AcademyXi-Phase0-Project/)

Description: This repo is created as part of the phase 0 assignment project for 'Front end developer'course at AcademyXi. 
This website is a personal portfolio website.

Languages used: HTML 5 and CSS (mostly flexbox) 
Fonts used: 'Andada Pro', serif (Google fonts)
Background colors: #4267B2 & #cce2eb (Inspired by Facebook website)

Currently this website has a header with a Logo (my name) on the left and navigation buttons to the right. 
The navigation buttons do not have any links associated with them.

There are two 2 sections. The first section contains my profile photo (Currently has a dummy photo) and a summary of my experience.
The second section has the logos of the 4 companies that I've worked for.

I intend to add more functionality to this website as I progress through the course.
